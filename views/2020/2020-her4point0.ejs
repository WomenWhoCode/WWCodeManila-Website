          <p>
            <strong>HER</strong> is Women Who Code Manila’s flagship event for
            international women’s month every March. This event is a big get
            together of all women in tech in the Philippines so that we can
            inspire one another to succeed in our tech careers. It focuses
            mainly on helping our member’s soft skills since all year-round, our
            community events are focus on technical skills (study groups,
            hackathons, techup sessions, conferences and more). <br /><br />
            <strong
              >This 2020, we are now in version 4.0 and our theme is "Own
              it!"</strong
            >
            Owning your achievements, owning your success whether big or small
            and being proud of it. <br /><br />
            We want to help them break the fear of imposter syndrome.
            <br />
            We want to help them recognize their achievements and be confident
            to own it.
            <br />
            We want to applaud every member for their contribution in our tech
            industry.
            <br /><br />
            We believe it is necessary for everyone's growth and professional
            development to acknowledge their success and not be afraid to accept
            it. We hope that this event can help everyone feel more confident
            about themselves and in what they do.
            <br /><br />
            Ladies, hope to see you at Her 4.0! #OwnIt
