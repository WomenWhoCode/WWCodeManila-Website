          <p>
          <strong>HER</strong> is Women Who Code Manila’s flagship event for international women’s month every March. This event is a big get together of all women in tech in the Philippines so that we can inspire one another to succeed in our tech careers. It focuses mainly on helping our member’s soft skills since all year-round, our community events are focus on technical skills (study groups, hackathons, techup sessions, conferences and more).  
          <br /><br />
          <strong>This 2020, we are now in version 4.0 and our theme is "Own it!"</strong> Owning your achievements, owning your success whether big or small and being proud of it.  
          <br /><br />
          We want to help them break the fear of imposter syndrome. 
          <br />
          We want to help them recognize their achievements and be confident to own it. 
          <br />
          We want to applaud every member for their contribution in our tech industry.
          <br /><br />
          We believe it is necessary for everyone's growth and professional development to acknowledge their success and not be afraid to accept it. We hope that this event can help everyone feel more confident about themselves and in what they do.  
          <br /><br />
          Ladies, hope to see you at Her 4.0! #OwnIt
